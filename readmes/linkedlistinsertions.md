 ##LinkedList Insertions
In this code challenge I wrote the following methods to add to my LinkedList class: append(), insertBefore(), and insertAfter().  I also added the following helper functions: hasNext(), getHeadValue(), and getLastValue().  The last two I made to help test the code in the library, while hasNext() helps with iteration from within the class.
 
 ### Approach & Efficiency
The approach I took to all of these methods was     
 
 insert()
 Time: O(1)
 Space: O(n)
 
 includes()
 Time: O(n)
 Space: O(n)
 
 print()
 Time: O(n)
 Space: O(1)
 
 
 ### Solution
  <img src="../assets/insert-before.jpg"
       alt="White Board Picture"
       style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 200px;" />
       
  <img src="../assets/append.jpg"
         alt="White Board Picture"
         style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 200px;" />
